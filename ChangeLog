So far unreleased version (TVu)

	- Added IPv6 support. IPv6 addresses should now work in every place
	  where IPv4 addresses have worked, with one exception: IPv6 addresses
	  are currently not exported to DHCP. This will be fixed later once the
	  DNS part of Sauron has reached some degree of stability. [TVu]
	- Mixed IPv6/IPv4 addresses (xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:dd.dd.dd.dd) are accepted
	  as input, but are converted to pure IPv6 by the database. [TVu]
	- In IPv6 and mixed cidrs the mask length must be a multiple of 4. This
	  limitation is related to handling of ip6.arpa format addresses (see
	  cidr2arpa and arpa2cidr in Util.pm), and removing it may be possible
	  in a future version, with more expertise. We feel that this limitation
	  does not affect the use of Sauron in any major way. [TVu]
	- Form and output fields have been widened to accomodate IPv6 addresses.
	  [TVu]
	- For IPv6 sub and virtual nets, Net Info now shows net usage under
	  (rather than to the right of) the other data. For blocks with less
	  than one million addresses, the exact size is given; for larger blcoks
	  only appoximate size is shown, e.g. ~10^14. (Producing this list was
	  the single most demanding IPv6-related change.) [TVu]
	- New configuration options in Sauron configuration file [TVu]
	  - $LOOPBACK_NET has been replaced by $LOOPBACK_NET_IPv4 and
	    $LOOPBACK_NET_IPv6. These, if defined, are used in import scripts
	  - A new option, $SAURON_ZERO_IP has been added. It is used in Hosts.pm
	    and Utils.pm to define zero ip address as '0.0.0.0' or '::' in cases
	    where the program can't deduce it.
	- Net::Netmask (which does not support IPv6) has been completely
	  replaced by NetAddr::IP or by writing new code. [TVu]
	- Tests of form "$var eq 't' || $var == 1" were changed to "$var eq 't'
	  || $var eq '1'" because "'f' == 1" returns true when "use bignum;" is
	  used. This and other 'features' of bignum have likely caused other as
	  yet undiscovered bugs, but bignum is needed to represent IPv6s as 128-
	  bit integers. [TVu]
	- In Add zone and Edit zone you can give a cidr as reverse zone name;
	  Sauron will convert it to an arpa format zone name. E.g.
	  2001:bad:cafe::/48 -> e.f.a.c.d.a.b.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa [TVu]
	- To the top of the host information form a new drop-down list has been
	  added for the host's IP addresses. Buttons "This Subnet", "Ping",
	  "Traceroute", "Copy" and "Move" now use the selected address instead
	  of only using the first one. "Network Settings" is not affected,
	  instead, it now shows settings for all addresses. While these changes
	  are not strictly related to IPv6, we expect them to be useful
	  especially in dual-stack environments. (Previously "Move" was not
	  supported at all for hosts with multiple addresses.) [TVu]
	- In Edit Net, when the net has auto address range, it now also has "IP
	  address assignment policy" with these options:
	  - "Lowest free" and "Higest free". These should be self-explanatory.
	    Between Range start and Range end, inclusive. "Lowest free" is the
	    default.
	  - "MAC based". IPv6 nets only. IPv6 addresses will combine the subnet
	    prefix (max. 64 bits) and the MAC (Ethernet) address. In the latter
	    'fffe' will be inserted and the seventh bit from left will be
	    inverted. When you add a host you must give the MAC, otherwise Sauron
	    will not be able to create the IP address.
	  - "IPv4 based". IPv6 nets only. IPv6 addresses will combine the subnet
	    prefix (max. 96 bits) and the host's existing IPv4 address. Thus,
	    this option is only useful when you are adding IPv6 addresses to old
	    hosts. [TVu]
	- In Edit Host Sauron will try to show a new drop-down list next to IP
	  address / Add button. The list is based on the subnets (and any
	  included virtual nets) that share the same VLAN as the existing IP
	  addresses, suggesting one possible address from each net based on that
	  net's IP address assignment policy. Thus, if you create an IPv6 network
	  structure that parallels your old IPv4 network, assigning the IPv6 nets
	  to the same VLANs as the IPv4 nets, you can add an IPv6 address to each
	  host from this list. Select a net and leave the address field empty,
	  then press "Add". The same policies are used when you add or copy a
	  host; in the latter case based on the address that you selected at the
	  top of the page before pressing "Copy", if the host has multiple IP
	  addresses. When you copy an IPv4 host, Sauron will suggest a new address
	  as before, but based on the net's policy (instead of "next free"). For
	  an IPv6 host a suggestion will only be shown if net's policy is "Lowest
	  free" or "Higest free"; otherwise an address will be created when you
	  create the host. If net policy is "MAC based", no IP address can be
	  created before you have given the MAC. Note also that "Ethernet address"
	  has been changed to "MAC address" on the forms. [TVu]
	- A new command line utility 'addipv6' has been added. With it you can add
	  IPv6 addresses to hosts in entire subnets or even larger parts of your
	  network with a single command. The utility includes its own
	  documentation. [TVu]
	- IPv6 additions by Teppo Vuori [TVu].
	- When a list of hosts in a single net is shown, net name and cidr are
	  also displayed. [TVu]
	- "Download CSV" button has been added to Browse Nets. The CSV list can
	  be opened e.g. in a spreadsheet program. This feature is useful if you
	  have to create reports about IP address usage. [TVu]
	- WITH OIDS has been added to all table creation scripts, since this is
	  no longer PostgreSQL's default. [TVu]
	- Colour coding has been reversed in Net Usage Map; green background now
	  indicates free addresses. [TVu]
	- --disable and --enable have been added to modhosts. [TVu]
	- moduser and modgroup have a new option --add="defhost,<template>"
	  The template is used when the user adds or copies a host. The template
	  can include one variable, %{id}, which Sauron will replace with the new
	  host's id, e.g. h%{id}.exam -> h12045.exam [TVu]
	- moduser or modgroup may give a message like
	  WARNING:  nonstandard use of \\ in a string literal
	  HINT: Use the escape string syntax for backslashes, e.g., E'\\'.
	  Fix includes setting "standard_conforming_strings = on" (the default in
	  newer versions) in postgresql.conf - see
	  https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/comp.databases.
	  postgresql/y3u3e6LrtBw - you will have to make this change, as we can't
	  make it for you. [TVu]
	- For Host aliases, the "Alias for" field maxlen prperty has been
	  extended to 254 characters to accomodate aliases provided by Google.
	  [Riku Meskanen & TVu]
	- update-dhcp-info can now handle change-of-year in the log file that it
	  reads, provided that there are no gaps longer than one year in the
	  file. The file can span multiple years. If you use a log file where the
	  last line is not from the current year, give the year of the *last*
	  line as parameter. [TVu]
	- Expiration date has been added to zone display. This date affects
	  creation of named.conf, zone files, reverse maps and dhcpd.conf. The
	  date can be used to temporarily disable a zone by setting its
	  expiration into the past. [TVu]
	- Option --list="members,<groupname>" has been added to modgroups to
	  list all members of a user group. [TVu]
	- Zone comment field has been widenend from 60 to 80 characters, but
	  maximum text length has been increased to 200 characters. If the field
	  contains "http://" or "https://", anything from that to the end will
	  be turned into a link when the comment is shown. E.g. if you write
	  "Google: http://google.com", "Google: google.com" will be shown, and
	  that "google.com" will act as a link which opens a new tab / window.
	  Any parameters and/or fragment identifier will not be shown, but they
	  will remain part of the link. With this feature you can link to
	  extended comments in a wiki or whatever. [TVu]
	- A new option, "Any domain", has been added to host search. By checking
	  this you can search hosts in all domains to which you have read
	  access (all domains if restrictions have not been turned on in
	  configuration file or if you are superuser). Current server only. Full
	  domain names will be shown in the list. Note that though this option
	  is next to host (domain) pattern, these items are independent. Fully
	  Qualified Domain Names are also shown when you view or edit host
	  information, just in case the search only found one host, and the list
	  is not shown. [TVu]
	- Variable $ALEVEL can now be added to a plugin's configuration file to
	  define minimum authorization level required to use that plugin.
	  Default is 0. See 'sample.conf'. [TVu]
	- Search host now also finds hosts whose subgroup matches the selected
	  group. [TVu]
	- Small bugfixes, especially a few cases where a command-line tool
	  should skip some records in the input, and may even have said taht it
	  does, but didn't. [TVu]
